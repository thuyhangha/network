The differences between csmacd, csma-ca without hidden and csma-ca with hidden
1. CSMA CD takes effect after a collision while CSMA CA takes effect before a collision.
2. CSMA CA reduces the possibility of a collision while CSMA CD only minimizes the recovery time.
3. CSMA CD is typically used in wired networks while CSMA CA is used in wireless networks.
CSMA CD operates by detecting the occurrence of a collision. Once a collision is detected, CSMA CD immediately terminates the transmission so that the transmitter does not have to waste a lot of time in continuing. The last information can be retransmitted
CSMA CA does not deal with the recovery after a collision. What it does is to check whether the medium is in use. If it is busy, then the transmitter waits until it is idle before it starts transmitting.

1. What are the SSIDs of the two access points that are issuing most of the beacon frames in this trace?  

30 Munroe St and linsys_SES_24086

2.What are the intervalsof time between the transmissionsof the beacon frames the linksys_ses_24086access point? From the30 Munroe St. access point?(Hint: this interval of time is contained in the beacon frame itself).

The beacon interval for both access points in reported in the Beacon Interval of the 802.11 wireless LAN Management frame as .1024 seconds 

3.What (in hexadecimal notation) is the source MACaddress on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?Recall from Figure 6.13 in the text that the source, destination, and BSS are three addresses used in an 802.11 frame.  For a detailed discussion of the 802.11 frame structure, see section 7 in the IEEE 802.11 standards document (cited above).

The source MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St is 00:16:b6:f7:1d:51 

4.What (in hexadecimal notation) is the destination MAC address on thebeacon framefrom 30 Munroe St?

The destination MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

5.What (in hexadecimal notation) is the MAC BSS id on the beacon framefrom 30 Munroe St?

The MAC BSS id on the beacon framefrom 30 Munroe St is 00:16:b6:f7:1d:51

6.The beacon frames from the 30 Munroe Staccess point advertise that the access point can support four data ratesand eight additional “extended supported rates.”What are these rates

These rates are 1.0, 2.0, 5.5, 11.0 Mbps

9. What two actions are taken (i.e., frames are sent) by the host in the trace just after t=49, to end the association with the 30 Munroe St AP that was initially in place when trace collection began?  (Hint: one is an IP-layer action, and one is an 802.11-layer action).Looking at the 802.11 specification, is there another frame that you might have expected to see, but don’t see here?

At t = 49.583615 a DHCP release is sent by the host to the DHCP server (whose IP address is 192.168.1.1) in the network that the host is leaving. At t = 49.609617, the host sends a DEAUTHENTICATION frame (Frametype = 00 [Management], subframe type = 12[Deauthentication]).  One might have expected to see a DISASSOCIATION request to have been sent. 

10.Examinethe trace file and look for AUTHENICATION framessent from the host to anAP and vice versa.How many AUTHENTICATION messages are sent from the wireless hostto the linksys_ses_24086AP (which has a MAC address of Cisco_Li_f5:ba:bb) starting at aroundt=49? . 

The first AUTHENTICATION from the host to the AP is at  t = 49.638857

11.Does the host want the authentication to require a key or be open?

The host is requesting that the association be open

12.Do you see a reply AUTHENTICATION from the linksys_ses_24086APin the trace?

No, I do not see reply AUTHENTICATION from the linksys_ses_24086APin the trace

13.Now let’s consider what happens as the host gives up trying to associate with the linksys_ses_24086APand now tries to associatewith the 30 Munroe StAP. Look for AUTHENICATION frames sent from the host to and AP and vice versa. At what times arethere an AUTHENTICATION frame from the host to the 30 Munroe St.AP, and when is there a reply AUTHENTICATION sent from that AP to the host in reply? (Note that you can use the filter expression “wlan.fc.subtype ==11and wlan.fc.type ==0 and wlan.addr ==IntelCor_d1:b6:4f” to display only the AUTHENTICATIONframes inthis tracefor this wireless host.)

At t = 63.16, there is a AUTHENTICATION frame sent from 00:13:02:d1:b6:4f to 00:16:b7:f7:1d:51 at t= 63.168087. 
At t =  63.16, there is an AUTHENTICATION sent from the BSS to the wireless host at t = 169071. 

14.An ASSOCIATE REQUEST from host to AP, and acorresponding ASSOCIATE RESPONSE frame from AP to host are used for thehost to associatedwith an AP.  At what time is there an ASSOCIATE REQUEST from host to the30 Munroe StAP?  When is the corresponding ASSOCIATE REPLY sent? (Note that you canuse the filter expression “wlan.fc.subtype < 2 and wlan.fc.type ==0 and wlan.addr ==IntelCor_d1:b6:4f” to display only the ASSOCIATE REQUEST and ASSOCIATE RESPONSE framesfor this trace.)

At t = 63.169910 there is a ASSOCIATE REQUEST frame sent from 00:13:02:d1:b6:4f (the wireless host) to 00:16:b7:f7:1d:51 (the BSS). At t =  63.192101 there is an ASSOCIATE RESPONSE from sent in the reverse direction from the BSS to the wireless host

15.What transmission rates is the host willing to use?  The AP? To answer this question, you will need to look into the parameters fields of the 802.11 wireless LAN management frame

In the ASSOCIATION REQUEST frame, the supported rates are advertised as 1, 2, 5.5, 11, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 32, 48, and 54 Mbps
