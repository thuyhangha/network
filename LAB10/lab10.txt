a) No. E can check the subnet prefix of Host F’s IP address, and then learn that F is on the same LAN. Thus, E will not send the packet to the default router R1.
Ethernet frame from E to F:
Source IP = E’s IP address
Destination IP = F’s IP address
Source MAC = E’s MAC address
Destination MAC = F’s MAC address
b) No, because they are not on the same LAN. E can find this out by checking B’s IP address.
Ethernet frame from E to R1:
Source IP = E’s IP address
Destination IP = B’s IP address
Source MAC = E’s MAC address
Destination MAC = The MAC address of R1’s interface connecting to Subnet 3.
c) Switch S1 will broadcast the Ethernet frame via both its interfaces as the received ARP frame’s destination address is a broadcast address. And it learns that A resides on Subnet 1 which is connected to S1 at the interface connecting to Subnet 1. And, S1 will update its forwarding table to include an entry for Host A.
Yes, router R1 also receives this ARP request message, but R1 won’t forward the
message to Subnet 3. B won’t send ARP query message asking for A’s MAC address, as
this address can be obtained from A’s query message. Once switch S1 receives B’s
response message, it will add an entry for host B in its forwarding table, and then drop
the received frame as destination host A is on the same interface as host B (i.e., A and B
are on the same LAN segment).

P17.
a) No, E and F are at the same network.
Ethernet frame from E to F:
Source IP = E’s IP address
Destination IP = F’s IP address
Source MAC = E’s MAC address
Destination MAC = F’s MAC address

b) No, because they are not on the same LAN. E can find this out by checking B’s IP address.
